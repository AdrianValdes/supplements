### Aging

| **Supplement** | **Why** | **How to Take** | **Warnings** |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| **Blueberries**    | The anthocyanins and pterostilbene in blueberries can help protect the brain and reduce cognitive decline. | Blueberry anthocyanins: 0.5–1 g/day, Blueberry powder: 12 g/day, Freeze-dried blueberries: 24 g/day, Fresh blueberries: 60–120 g/day | Could cause low blood sugar, although very unlikely. |
| **Carnitine**      | Plays a role in cognition, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular health. | For neurological benefits, take acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR). Start with 250 mg twice a day (i.e., 500 mg/day). Over the course of a week, increase to 500 mg twice a day (i.e., 1 g/day). For general non-neurological benefits, take 2 grams of L-carnitine per day, with carbohydrates if you wish to increase the rate of absorption by the muscles. | Side effects are generally rare, but some cases of upset stomachs have been reported. |
| **Protein**        | -       | 160-175g daily. 30-45g per meal. | - |
| **B12**            | Suboptimal intake of vitamin B12 can cause anemia, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, nerve damage, and other health problems. | Take 100–400 mcg/day | - |
| **Vitamin D**      | -       | 2000 IU - 4000 IU. Vitamins D and K may increase synergistically the rate at which minerals accumulate in bones. | - |
| **Secondary Options** | Creatine, DHEA, MACA (for libido), Magnesium, Vitamin K. | | - |
| **Core Combo** | Each day, take 100–400 mcg of vitamin B12. Each day, take blueberries according to one of the provided protocols. Twice a day, take 250–500 mg of ALCAR (i.e., 500–1,000 mg/day). Consume protein throughout the day. If 25(OHD) levels are adequate, 400 IU (10 mcg) of vitamin D3 per day. If 25(OH)D levels are low, 800–2,000 IU (20–50 mcg) of D3 per day. | These three supplements are hypotensive agents, so start at the low end of the dosage range and monitor your blood pressure. |

### Muscle Gain

| **Supplement** | **Why** | **How to Take** | **Warnings** |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| **Creatine**       | Creatine monohydrate is backed by strong evidence for both its safety and its ability to increase power output and anaerobic endurance. | Take 5 grams of creatine monohydrate with food. | - |
| **Nitrates**       | Elevated NO levels during exercise provide a variety of benefits. Nitrate supplementation has been shown to improve aerobic endurance, power output, blood flow, and muscle recovery between bouts of exercise. | There are no pills, but it is found in veggies. Aim for 6.4–12.8 mg of nitrates per kilogram of body weight. | Most vegetables rich in nitrates are also rich in oxalate, which can increase the risk of kidney stones. People already at an increased risk of forming kidney stones, as well as people with oxalosis or hyperoxaluria, should keep their oxalate intake to a minimum. |

| **Sugar and Carbs** | -       | -               | - |
| **Secondary Options** | - | Beta-Alanine, Caffeine | - |

### Cardiovascular Health

| **Supplement** | **Why** | **How to Take** | **Warnings** |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| **Cocoa**          | Low nitric oxide (NO) levels can cause blood vessels to narrow, leading to reduced blood flow. Cocoa polyphenols help support NO levels, and research shows that cocoa does improve blood flow. | The standard daily dose for cocoa polyphenols is 1 g, obtained by eating about 30 g of cocoa powder or 40 g of dark chocolate with a 75% cocoa content. | - |
| **Garlic**         | Garlic enhances nitric oxide (NO) signaling and fights atherosclerosis. It may cause a minor decrease in blood pressure. | Eat 3–6 cloves daily over several meals OR take 600–1,200 mg of an aged garlic extract daily. | Taking too much garlic, or taking garlic with other hypotensive agents, could cause low blood pressure. |
| **Nitrates**       | See Muscle Gain | - | - |
| **Secondary Options** | - | Carnitine, CoQ10, Fish Oil, Grape Seed, Resveratrol, Taurine, Venotropics, Vitamin K | - |
| **Core Combo** | Take 1 g of cocoa polyphenols. Take 3 to 6 cloves of garlic or 600–1,200 mg of an aged garlic extract daily. Take nitrate-rich vegetables. These three supplements are hypotensive agents, so start at the low end of the dosage range and monitor your blood pressure. | - |

### Bone Health

| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| **Protein**        | Essential for bone health. | See Aging | - |
| **Vitamin D**      | Supports bone health. | - | - |
| **Vitamin K**      | Vitamin K supports blood clotting and calcium regulation, strengthening bones and reducing cardiovascular disease risk. | Take 200 mcg (0.2 mg) of MK-7 and/or 45,000 mcg (45 mg) of MK-4. | Vitamin K is usually safe. Do not supplement with vitamin K if you have been prescribed blood thinners. |
| **Secondary Options** | - | Calcium, Magnesium | - |
| **Core Combo** | With a meal containing fat, take vitamin K. Consume at least 1.4 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day or at least 90 g/day, whichever is higher. | - |

### Blood Sugar

| **Supplement** | **Why** | **How to Take** | **Warnings** |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------ |

If not consumed with sufficient fluids, a high-fiber diet may cause an intestinal obstruction. |
| **Secondary Options** | - | Berberine, Inositol, Magnesium, Zinc | - |
